The **1.5kt Nuclear bomb** is a free-fall Air-to-Ground bomb that is used for targeting and destroying large areas of ground targets. While weaker than the 20kt Cruise Missile, it is harder to shoot down; Since the bomb has no heat signature, it can only be shot down by radar missiles.

When dropped, the bomb creates an exclusion zone is marked on the map for allied aircraft. This is the zone which marks the span of a strong shockwave and a fireball, which can potentially destroy your own aircraft. Within this zone, all buildings, vehicles, and airplanes get destroyed, or severely damaged. 

The effective range is different depending on the conditions in which it is dropped from.
