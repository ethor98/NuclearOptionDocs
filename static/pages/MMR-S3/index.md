An **MMR-S3** is an Air-to-Air medium range heat seeking missile that is used for targeting and destroying air targets from aircraft.



Its effective range varies greatly, and it depends on which direction is the target aircraft flying, how fast and how good is it's heat signature. Since the missile locks onto the hottest object in its sight, flares can be used to confuse the missiles tracking system, at which point the missile will lock onto and attack the flare, instead of the target aircraft. The best way to counter these missiles is to turn your engines away from them, or turn them off momentarily, as they are the biggest source of heat, and release flares.
