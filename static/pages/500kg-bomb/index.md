The **500kg bomb** is an optically guided bomb Air-to-Ground bomb. Fifty times stronger than the [AGM-48](/w/AGM-48) missile, and almost 4 times stronger than the [AGM-68](/w/AGM-68) missile, it delivers a very strong explosion capable of destroying well fortified buildings, and large convoys. 

Since it has no propulsion or heat signature, so it can only be shot down by radar missiles. The downside being however that the aircraft dropping the bomb has to be approximately above the ground target, which opens a window for the ground target to shoot it down. While it has no propulsion, it is optically guided, which means it tilts its fins to guide itself more accurately on the moving target.

It has a surface burst warhead, which means instead of exploding in the air right before the impact like the AGM missiles, it explodes over a large area on impact.

The effective range is different depending on the conditions in which it is dropped from.
