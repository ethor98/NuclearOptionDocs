**CI-22 Cricket** is a subsonic attack aircraft well suited for counter insurgency operations and low-intensity battlefields, featuring a robust landing gear which allows for short takeoff and landing capability, allowing it to operate from unprepared fields such as highway strips. 


### Details 
---
The aircrafts main focus are low-altitude anti-ground vehicle strikes, either using its AGR-18 Lynchpin rockets, or using its internal 12.7mm rotary gunpod. Additional 12.7mm or 20mm gunpods can be mounted on all other pylons, making the plane into a very powerful cannon. 

It does not have high speed, defenses, or agility, therefore it cannot easily defend against fast moving enemy aircraft. It lacks radar jamming capabilities and speed to evade radar missiles, it cannot operate in heavily defended territory, therefore it is only good for ground strikes in team defended areas, without a high enemy aircraft or SAM presence. 

Other than its signature lynchpin rockets and cannons, it can also be equipped with a smaller amount of IR rockets for defending against enemy aircraft, and both the [AGM-48s](/w/AGM-48) and the [AGM-68s](/w/AGM-68)
