The **FS-12 Revoker** is an advanced fighter jet built for agility, capable of extreme maneuvers, featuring an afterburner which enables it to fly at supersonic speeds at low altitudes.


### Details 
---

The FS-12 jet is equipped with a single engine, which adds to its agility and maneuverability during air combat. This agility is advantageous in certain tactical situations, such as dogfights or close air support missions. The single engine is equipped with a powerful afterburner, which significantly improves its takeoff and climb performance, which is advantageous when taking off of short runways and increases the aircraft's ability to quickly gain altitude, which can be critical in certain tactical scenarios such as quickly intercepting missiles flying towards an airfield, without much holdup with taxiing and waiting to gain speed from the ground.

In contrast to the T/A-30 jet, the FS-12 demonstrates a more specialized focus on air-to-air combat rather than providing extensive flexibility in terms of weapons selection. Its main weapons are the [MMR-S3 heat-seeking missiles](/w/MMR-S3), and a 20 mm internal HE cannon, which both enable effective means of dogfighting other planes, or attacking them from a distance with the heat seeking missiles. Options for ground support are also avalible, as the jet can also be equipped with [500kg bombs](/w/500kg-bomb), a [1.5kt nuclear bomb](/w/1.5kt-nuke), or the more advanced [AGM-68 optical missiles](/w/AGM-68). 




> "The FS-12 Revoker is built for agility above all else, capable of extreme maneuvers at almost any speed. Internal weapon bays help reduce drag, allowing supersonic speeds even at low altitudes and with heavy payloads."
